# AI-Voice-Assistant-using-python-simple-
This project is a Python-based AI Voice Assistant that can listen to user voice commands, understand them using speech recognition, and respond intelligently through voice output. The project demonstrates the practical implementation of Artificial Intelligence, Speech Processing, and Automation using Python libraries.
It is suitable for beginners as well as students learning AI, NLP, and automation concepts.
The assistant can perform multiple tasks such as searching information on Wikipedia, telling jokes, playing videos on YouTube, sending WhatsApp messages, controlling basic system operations, and responding with synthesized speech.
